# AndroidTestApp
Application to mess around with

Small andriod app to practice the features and to act as a reference point for my later work.

I know it is called CameraTestApp - I was going to do something else with it and I'm too lazy to change the name. 

Tried to comment as much as I can so that it is easily understandable for myself in the future. 

Added the "cheat" files - contain useful shit that I kept forgetting, they are not intended to be run.

Gonna add a fuckton of stuff to do with SQLlite, either in its own named file or just shoehorned into the main prog.

Like I said, this is reference repo.
